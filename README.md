# FCFS_scheduling_algorithm_c
FCFS Scheduling Algorithm Implementation


Description


This C program implements the First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm. FCFS is a simple scheduling algorithm that executes processes in the order they arrive.


Features


- Calculates waiting time and turnaround time for each process
- Calculates average waiting time and average turnaround time
- Displays process IDs, burst times, waiting times, and turnaround times in a table
- Supports user input for number of processes and burst times


Usage


1. Clone the repository using `git clone (link unavailable)
2. Compile the program using gcc fcfs.c -o fcfs
3. Run the program using ./fcfs
4. Enter the number of processes and burst times when prompted


Code Structure


- fcfs.c: Main program file containing FCFS implementation
- findWaitingTime(): Function to calculate waiting time for each process
- findTurnAroundTime(): Function to calculate turnaround time for each process
- findAverageTime(): Function to calculate average waiting time and average turnaround time
